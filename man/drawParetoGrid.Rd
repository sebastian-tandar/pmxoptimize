\title{Draw Pareto Optimization Grid}
\usage{
drawParetoGrid(
  opt_object,
  grid_values = c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1),
  opt_history_name = "PSO-LBFGSB",
  nonzero_fraction_threshold = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{opt_object}{An optimization task object as created by \code{initiateOptimizationTask}. Must include previously run optimization history.}

\item{grid_values}{Numeric vector. Defines the set of relative weights to assign to each objective. Default is \code{c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)}.}

\item{opt_history_name}{Character. The method name used in the previous optimization run (e.g., \code{"PSO-LBFGSB"}), which also serves as the prefix for the CSV file containing optimization history (e.g., \code{"PSO-LBFGSB_OptimizationHistory.csv"}).}

\item{nonzero_fraction_threshold}{Numeric. Threshold for determining whether an objective varies meaningfully across history. Objectives that are zero in more than \code{(1 - threshold)} of runs are fixed to the lowest priority. Default is \code{0.05}.}
}
\value{
The updated \code{opt_object} with a new \code{paretoGrid} element and status. The grid is also saved to \code{ParetoGrid.csv} in the project directory.
}
\description{
Creates a grid of relative objective weights for multi-objective optimization. The grid is built
using historical optimization results to identify which objectives vary meaningfully, and constructs
combinations of normalized weights across those objectives. The resulting grid is saved to file and
stored in the optimization object.
}
\details{
Note: \code{\link{runOptimization}} or \code{\link{runOptimization_Multiple}} must be run beforehand to generate the optimization history file required for this function.
